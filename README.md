# lilbud

Lil Bud is my first embedded system project.

He's a little tamagotchi inspired dude that is based on a face drawings from [lil bud maker](https://github.com/zapplebee/lilbudmaker).

eventually, once i have enough samples, he'll be model that can generate the lilbud faces.

Right now, the only target is SLD2.

But eventually, he'll get built to push on to this board:

and I'll get to wear him like a pin
